# ML Based Stroke Risk Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the risk of a stroke based on various input features. It analyzes a person's medical data and lifestyle information to assess whether they are at risk of having a stroke in the near future.

## About

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a person suffering from a stroke based on various factors such as age, blood pressure, smoking habits, and other health-related metrics. The model uses machine learning algorithms to classify the risk into different categories.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation)

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is from [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). It includes features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Hypertension status
- Heart disease status
- Marital status
- Smoking status
- Blood pressure levels
- BMI
