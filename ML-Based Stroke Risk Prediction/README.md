# ML Based Stroke Risk Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the risk of a stroke based on various input features. It analyzes a person's medical data and lifestyle information to assess whether they are at risk of having a stroke in the near future.

## About

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a person suffering from a stroke based on various factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, and other health-related metrics. The model uses machine learning algorithms to classify the risk into different categories based on input features.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation)

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is from the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). It includes features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Serum cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
- Exercise induced angina (exang)
- Oldpeak (depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Based-Stroke-Risk-Detection.git

2. Change directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ML-Based-Stroke-Risk-Detection
   
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle's Heart Disease Dataset and place it in the data/ folder.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and train the machine learning model:
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stroke_risk_prediction.ipynb
   
3. The final model can be used to predict stroke risk by providing input data for the model.

## Model Development

1. _Data Preprocessing:_
         The dataset is cleaned, and necessary transformations are applied (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical features).
3. _Model Selection:_
         Various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) are evaluated for prediction accuracy.
5. _Model Training:_
         The best model is trained and optimized using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
